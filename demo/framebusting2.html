  <h1>Blocking framebusting with javascript by using the HTML5
  sandbox </h1>

  This page includes <a href="framebuster.html"><tt>framebuster.html</tt></a> as iframe, but that sub-page will try to bust out of its frame.

  <p>

  But using the HTML5 sandbox feature we can prevent any
  included iframes from trying to bust out of their frame,
  as shown below. This can be done by the
  default <tt>sandbox</tt> option, which not allow any scripts to
  run

  <p>

  <iframe allow-scripts src="framebuster.html" sandbox width="700" height="250"></iframe> 

  <p>

  Even if we allow scripts to run in the iframe, with
  <tt>sandbox="allow-scripts"</tt>, the iframe is still not
  allowed to navigate up to its parent, as shown below

  <p>

  <iframe allow-scripts src="framebuster.html" sandbox="allow-scripts" width="700" height="250"></iframe> 

  </body>
</html>
