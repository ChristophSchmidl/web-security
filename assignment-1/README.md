# Assignment 1

* In lesson "Insecure Storage - Encoding Basics" of WebGoat, what is the name of the encoding for the string field (the one after "Enter a string") in the HTTP request?

	* If we take the following string as input without the quotation marks "string&test", we'll get the following encoded string "string%26test". 
	* ![EnterAString](img/encoding.PNG)
	* Therefore, URL encoding is used.

* In lesson "Insecure Storage - Encoding Basics" of WebGoat, what is the name of the encoding which is used for the (optional) password? (Hint: use your proxy to inspect the characters which you enter as inputs and their corresponding encoding in the HTTP request)

	* Given the image above, the optional password field is using the same encoding as the "Enter a string"-field. The ID of "Enter a string"-field is called "input" and the ID of the password-field is called "key". Both fields are using URL encoding.

* Inspect the HTTP traffic which is generated by the GET and POST actions on ../demo/demo_get_post.html}. Say an attacker eavesdrops your network traffic (i.e. a Man-in-the-Middle attack.) Does a GET request provide better protection than a POST request, or vice versa, or is there no difference?

	* Simple GET Request

	* Simple POST Request
		* ![EnterAString](img/post_request_raw.PNG)	

* Does a hidden field provide better protection than a non-hidden field, or vice versa, or is there no difference?

	* Hidden field GET Request
		* ![EnterAString](img/hidden_field_get_request_output.PNG)
		* ![EnterAString](img/hidden_field_get_request_raw.PNG)
	* Hidden field POST Request
